  <h1>Self-Driving car using Raspberry pi 4</h1>
</div>

<p align="center">
  This is a Self-Driving car (SDV) project which uses pi pico as a slave device and various sensor in order to work properly.
  <!-- TODO add some of the github badges and shields-->
</p>


## Features

* Stop signs detection
* Road lane following
* Turn Indicators
* Stop light(back side SDV)

## Quick start

First setup pico-sdk c environment ...

## Contributing [![contributions welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/contributions-welcome-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](issues.md)

Thank you for considering contributing to Raspberry pi Self Driving car!

First note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions with the program files.

We welcome any type of contribution, _not only code_. You can help with:
- **QA**: File bug reports, the more details you can give the better (e.g. images or videos)
- **New Features**: You can suggest an modifications or just ask for advancements in the old features of SDV.
- **Code**: Take a look at the [open issues](issues.md). Even if you can't write the code yourself, you can comment on them, showing that you care about a given issue matters. It helps us to handel them

## Facts
- History
  - This is the 8<sup>th</sup> version of the vehicle. Previous versions are not tracked by any version control system.
  - It was initially started in 2019-20 as just an obstacle avoiding vehicle.
  - The idea of this project came years(2010-11) back while playing with a old school RC car.
- Development
  - The project got a kick start while I was working on another project related to a science competition.
  - Later I decided to showcase this same SDV at the competition.
  - The development of this particular version(from scratch) took about 50hrs. However the knowledge and research is of years of hardwork.
  - A similar vehicle was developed in order to test the hardware potential of the chassis. [Here is the GitHub repo of that project](https://github.com/AmanRathoreP/Bluetooth-wireless-car-with-various-features "Bluetooth-wireless-car-with-various-features"). However, the code base of both the projects are quite different.
