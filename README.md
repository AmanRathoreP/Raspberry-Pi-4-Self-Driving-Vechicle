## About Observer
Observer is a person which can use a desktop app in order to communicate with the SDV to see some live data of the SDV in order to really see what's happening in it. The application for the observer is developed purely in Java and been focused on analyzing data as much as possible to get some cool insights.
Previously the observer application was in python and it was a bare minimum software. However, current application is a GUI based application and have some cool analytical features like live logs, different types of charts such as bar chart, gauge chart, pie chart, etc. and many more. Some of it's images are provided below.

## About User Display
This is kind of dashboard of a vehicle in reality we will have physical steering wheel, paddles etc. while driving but in order to test the SDV effectively I had designed an interface which works on multiple platforms. It simulates a real SDV for the controlling software

# Contributing [![contributions welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/contributions-welcome-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](issues.md)

Thank you for considering contributing to Raspberry pi Self Driving car!

First note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions with the program files.

We welcome any type of contribution, _not only code_. You can help with:
- **QA**: File bug reports, the more details you can give the better (e.g. images or videos)
- **New Features**: You can suggest an modifications or just ask for advancements in the old features of SDV.
- **Code**: Take a look at the [open issues](issues.md). Even if you can't write the code yourself, you can comment on them, showing that you care about a given issue matters. It helps us to handel them

# Facts
- History
  - This is the 8<sup>th</sup> version of the vehicle. Previous versions are not tracked by any version control system.
  - It was initially started in 2019-20 as just an obstacle avoiding vehicle.
  - The idea of this project came years(2010-11) back while playing with a old school RC car.
- Development
  - The project got a kick start while I was working on another project related to a science competition.
  - Later I decided to showcase this same SDV at the competition.
  - The development of this particular version(from scratch) took about 50hrs. However the knowledge and research is of years of hardwork.
  - A similar vehicle was developed in order to test the hardware potential of the chassis. [Here is the GitHub repo of that project](https://github.com/AmanRathoreP/Bluetooth-wireless-car-with-various-features "Bluetooth-wireless-car-with-various-features"). However, the code base of both the projects are quite different.
