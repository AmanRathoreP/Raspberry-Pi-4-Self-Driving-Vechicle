# Build
> This directory contains some of files build by java for our app
> 
## Contents of the directory includes the following
- resources folder containing all the external jar files which are used
- jar file generated by java for our app
- folder containing all the generated classes
- `generator.py` file helps to generate all the `.class` or `.java` file name in one go

## Creating build
### Manual build
Follow the below given steps in order to create your own _manual build_ for the app

1. Navigate to the __root directory of the app__ i.e. where you can see `app.java` file.

2. Now run below command for creating all the class for our app
```bash
javac -d build\classes -cp build\resources\*.jar @files_info.txt
```
> `files_info.txt` is the file containing all the names of the file which are used in the build. See [directory's README](../README.md) for more info.
1. Now head on the the classes directory in the build directory.
```bash
cd build\classes
```
1. Use the below command to get the runnable `.jar` for our app
```
jar cfve ..\app.jar app @classes_info.txt
```
> `classes_info.txt` is the file containing all the names of the classes used in our build. See [directory's README](classes/README.md) for more info.
1. Finally run our app's jar file using the below command
```
java -jar ..\app.jar
```
1. You can also run the app without creating the jar file using the below command
```
java app @classes_info.txt
```
### Automated build (only for Windows)

1. Navigate to the __root directory of the app__ i.e. where you can see `app.java` file.

2. Run the `build.bat` file using the below command
```bash
build.bat
```
