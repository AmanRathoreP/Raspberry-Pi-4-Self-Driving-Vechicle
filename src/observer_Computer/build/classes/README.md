# This directory contains the `.class`(you won't see these files) files which are generated by java.

## This directory also contains `classes_info.txt` file which has all the name and path of the classes use in the build.
### generating `classes_info.txt` file
while being in the classes directory use the below command to generate it
```bash
python ..\generator.py . class classes_info.txt
```


##  To know the commands used to generate these files head on to the [README of the build directory](../README.md) or perhaps [README of the project file](../../../../README.md)
